This data article describes two datasets with hotel demand data. One of the
hotels is a resort hotel and the other is a city hotel. The Given dataset
contains 119390 entries and has 32 columns.

Each observation represents a hotel booking. Both datasets comprehend
booking due to arrive between the 1st July of 2015 and the 31st of August
2017,including bookings that effectively arrived and bookings that were
canceled.

In this project we use descriptive analytics to understand the patterns, trends,
and anomalies in data. We used the dataset to perform different problems like:
Booking cancellation, number of stays in weekend or weekdays, number of
special requests, is there guest is repeated or not, average daily rates,
seasonality, favorite meal of the customers, types of room reserved by the
customers, customer type, where do the guest come from? And many other
things are performed in this project.

Our main objective is to find out the key metrics and solve the business
problems. For this, we will explore and visualize the dataset from Hotel booking
dataset using basic exploratory data analysis(EDA)techniques. We proceeded
further by following three main steps i.e., Data preprocessing, defining problem
statement and doing Data visualization.

Data preprocessing is the process of cleaning the data. In data preprocessing we
nullified the null values. Its an important step as null values in our dataset can
lead to errors in the interpretation.

We have analyzed this dataset from different angles and have come up with
interesting insights. Some of the concluded points are city hotels are the most
booked hotel types, booking increases during summer time and are at their
lowest during winter time and same is the case with average daily rates, BB is
most preferred meal type, cancellation rate in city hotel is higher than resort
hotel, low number of repeated guest and most visitors are from western
European countries. This can help in making strategic data-driven decisions by
the marketing team, finance team and technical team of all the Hotel booking
applications.
